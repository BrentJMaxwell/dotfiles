# Configuration File Conventions

## General

- Follow the native syntax/format of each tool
- Include inline comments explaining non-default or non-obvious settings
- Theme preference: **Catppuccin Macchiato** wherever a theme is configurable
- Font preference: **JetBrains Mono** where applicable

## Git Config

- `git/.gitconfig` — shared settings (aliases, core config, conditional includes)
- `git/.gitconfig-personal` — personal identity (name, email, signing key)
- `git/.gitconfig-snx` — work identity (name, email, signing key)
- Conditional includes select the right identity based on repo path:
  - `~/git/personal/` → personal config
  - `~/git/snx/` → work config

## Zsh Config

- `zsh/.zshrc` — main shell config with Oh My Zsh
- Plugins are managed via the `plugins=()` array in `.zshrc`
- Custom plugins (zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting) are cloned
  by the bootstrap script into `oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/`

## Tmux Config

- `tmux/.tmux.conf` — tmux configuration
- Plugin manager: TPM (Tmux Plugin Manager) at `~/.tmux/plugins/tpm`
- Plugins are declared with `set -g @plugin` directives
